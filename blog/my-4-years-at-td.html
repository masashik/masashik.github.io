			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>By the end of March 2021, I achieved my four years tenure at Toronto-Dominion Bank Financial Group (TD). I took
				a month to review what I achieved there and what skill set I can transfer for the next opportunity. The contents
				of this blog post are collected from the review and is written in that month as the summary of my four years
				career at TD and a short introduction of the current state of financial/banking industry, fintech
				ventures, and their relations.</p>

			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>I never imagined working in a bank as an software engineer since I graduated from school. I have been choosing
				technology companies, startups, or SaaS provider as my workplaces. FinTech ventures were often apprearing and
				trending in news feeds in 2016 to name Square, Stripe, Plaid, Mint, MoneyTree, LendingClub, and WealthSimple as
				examples. I was very curious about the FinTech because there are innovations happening even though
				financial
				businesses are heavily regulated and not easy to innovative. I want to understand what is happening with IT
				technologies for banks. Job landing on a bank is a new experience for me, and my first year is full of
				online
				and on-the-job trainings and some PoC projects and mentoring co-op students in my team. The first half of my
				second year was running and joining a series of hackathon events, and the other half was back to my typical
				enterprise architecture work. Third year was a special year since I got a chance to visit some of Silicon Valley
				technology companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook. It was also the year of the COVID-19 global pandemic
				started. My last year was full of COVID-19 related things and remote working shift.

			<h2 id="landing-on-the-job">Landing on the job</h2>
			<p>Landing on a new job is usually challenging in both good or bad ways. New work environments, new colleagues,
				and new tools are all exciting and stressful as well. Particulary the finance industry, it is a regulated
				industry and require a multiple onboarding step (Ex. A credit check and a rigorous work reference check.)</p>

			<h4 id="call-from-td-recruiter">Call from TD recruiter</h4>
			<p>I was working on DevOps projects as a configuration management engineer in another company in 2016, and one day
				I got a direct email from a TD recruiter, and we talked about the opportunity available at TD to work on banking
				API and cloud architecture. I was excited to hear that since I was just certified as AWS cloud architect at that
				time, and I was seeking cloud architect jobs. It was just a best timing for me to take the opportunity, and I
				agreed to proceed following job interviews. Another fascinating aspect of the opportunity was that the
				employer is the one of big five banks in Canada, and it will certainly add some reputable experience on my
				career, and I wanted to learn the FinTech industry as well.</p>

			<h4 id="interviews">Interviews</h4>
			<p>
				The interviews were conducted by a phone call interview and multiple on-site. I had already seeing news from
				LinkedIn feed regarding the FinTech boom, and I know what's happening, but my understanding is very superficial.
				I did a little more research on why the FinTech gets so much attention. I didn’t prepare for typical coding
				exercises, but instead review my work history and its projects and deepen my understanding of system
				architectures. The actual technical interviews were not difficult. I was only asked a general software
				development lifecycle and some system architecture related questions. I didn't forget to introduce my previous
				work experiences with pain points of past projects and explained my approaches on how I fixed them.
			</p>

			<h4 id="offer">Offer</h4>
			<p>
				The decision is made right after my last round interview, and I was confident that I did well in the
				interviews. I got notified the job offer next morning.
			</p>

			<h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding to the team</h2>
			<p>
				TD is a typical Canadian banking corporation, and it requires financially credible person to join the
				organization since they deal with people’s money. I was required to go through some backgroud checks with a
				private agency which is responsible for my credit score and past employment history. It took a few weeks, and I
				was feeling a little nervous during that period. I was finally notified my official start date, and I was ready,
				set, and go to work.
			</p>

			<h4 id="on-the-job-training">On the job training</h4>
			<p>
				There was no formal orientation regarding my position on what to do in the line of business where I belong to
				except some online training courses which I was required to take for general bank employees. Everything else is
				a on-the-job training.
			</p>
			<h4 id="getting-to-know-other-colleagues">Getting to know other colleagues</h4>
			<p>
				My direct supervisor asked me if I want to be introduced to other colleagues via him, but I replied as I would
				go explore people by myself. This is because of my strategy to make myself known from the work I will commit not
				by a executive's general introduction, which is often forgettable by people. There was no formal orientation
				regarding my position on what to do within the line of business where I belong to except some online training
				courses which I was required to take for learning general bank employees common sense.
			</p>

			<h2 id="first">First Year</h2>
			<p>
				The first year was a mixtrue of trainings, some commitments from my skill set, and mentorship to juniors and
				co-op students. It is a literally catch-up year to ongoing projects;I needed understand the team’s business
				domain, areas to improve, strength, and their position in the line of business, Enterprise Architecture
				department. I was also trying to understand the team’s own responsibilties and goals so that I can make a plan
				on what commitments I can contribute to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most of my initial work was hands-on software development for supporting senior architects’ ongoing projects.
				While doing these supportive tasks, I had been studying general enterprise API architectures and their patterns
				with exploring unique enterprise requirements by interviewing and attending the weekly architecture review board
				meetings.
			</p>

			<p>
				My supervisor had been working on setting the vision of the enterprise API architecture at that time, and I was
				initially helping him with my feedback on his PowerPoint deck regarding DevOps requirements.
			</p>

			<h4 id="move">Moving between offices - 100 Wellington West and 320 Front Street</h4>

			<p>
				The building I was working at did not accommodate the partnered engineering team who specializes in tooling API
				frameworks, and I often had to walk to the building for meetings and some senior managers for architecture
				planning.
			</p>

			<h4 id="poc">Proof of concept projects</h4>
			<p>
				There were two major proof of concept (PoC) projects executed during 2017;The fault-tolerant JVM
				back-end API server and the QR code based mobile payment platform.
			</p>

			<h5 id="circuit">1. Fault-tolerant API PoC - Netflix Circuit Breaker Library</h5>
			<p>
				Resiliency and fault-tolerant were the major discussion topics which my supervisor and senior colleagues had
				been discussing at for the enterprise API framework. There was a well-engineered Java written software
				circuit-breaker available from Netflix's open source projects, and I utilized it to implement that feature into
				the enterprise API framework. It actually worked quite well for the PoC purpose, and the software
				circuit-breaker came with the dashboard feature which enables us to visually observe the incoming API requests
				to the API framework and how the errorneous API requests are handled by the circuit-breaker as well.
			</p>

			<h5 id="unitedway">2. United Way Pay PoC</h5>
			<p>
				TD has been supporting the United Way, a charity organization, and my department started a department-wide
				charity campaign for them every year. My supervisor made a partnership with another enterprise payment team, and
				we started building a mobile payment platform for collecting donations.
			</p>

			<p>
				This mobile payment platform had some strategic requirements even though it is a proof of concept product. The
				mobile payment platform utilize the current developing fault-tolerant, authentication, and authorization API
				architecture.
			</p>

			<p>
				My responsibility was software development of an embedded iOS library in Objective-C as a part of the entire web
				API security framework for the iOS client application. The most iOS applications in the market were already
				developed in Swift language at that time, but some encryption libraries of our proof of concept project
				requires making access to iOS core functionalities, which were only available to Objective-C. There were not
				helpful documents of how to utilize the libraries, and I had to extremely struggle with them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mobile payment platform is conneceted to production fund transfer API, and its backend system can move the
				users' real money from their chequing account to the United Way campaign's designated bank account within the TD
				bank network. The employees who registered on the mobile payment platform made payments as donations for the
				United Way campaign.
			</p>

			<h4 id="coop">Co-op students</h4>
			<p>
				There were two co-op students who joined in 2017. One is from the University of Waterloo who helped us to
				execute our fault-tolerant API server project. The other one is from Ryerson University who also worked together
				for the United Way campaign project. Both of them are very energized and held a strong curiosity for
				technologies. They learned a lot and gained a substantial experience with the team, and both co-op students went
				to work for another reputable companies as software engineer upon their graduation.
			</p>

			<h2 id="second">Second Year</h2>
			<p>
				The second year is the year for deepening my understanding of the unique enterprise requirements in the
				enterprise API client authentication and authorization. One day in 2018, my supervisor gathered senior team
				members and I, and we started a series of case-study based discussions and trainings on how to judge good and
				bad enterprise API architectures. The team eventually finalized a general basic model template for building API
				architecture in a solutions architecture blueprint.
			</p>

			<p>
				While working on these discussions and trainings, I had started getting API architecture consulting works from
				solutions architects. These consulting works are the best cases which I can apply the modeled template to
				enforce the architecture standards. I was also assigned to join the weekly architecture review board meetings.
				It is a meeting to review every solution architecture proposed in TD, and I gained an enormous amount of
				knowledge from the meetings.
			</p>

			<h4 id="davinci">The virtual online banking platform - TD DaVinci</h4>
			<p>
				There were many hackathon events hosted in 2018 from small to large corporations. TD was also hosting internal
				hackathon events for its junior employees. Our API architecture team was responsible for building the virtual
				online banking platform which is simulating a production TD online banking website. The virtual online banking
				platform has some strategic requirements to prove the developing API architectures. One of the requirements is
				an integration with GitHub account and utilization of the associated user tokens to authenticate and authorize
				the users' interaction with the virtual online banking platform. The choice of the GitHub is because it
				implemented the OpenID Connect(OIDC) for its users' identity federation. This attempt is to experiment the
				utilization of the GitHub as an OIDC enabled identity federation service since the bank also plans to move
				to OIDC authorization services. Another requirement is to build a developer API portal with a collection of
				APIs to enable developers to programmtically access to the virtual online banking platform. This is for the
				future when open banking is available;where developers freely create financial client applications to expland
				FinTech market.

			</p>

			<h4 id="hackathon-td">Hackathon - TD internal corporate hackathon</h4>
			<p>
				The internal corporate hackathon event went to 3 days in a row, and there were about 30 teams joined from the
				all junior employees. They came up with a variety of financial applications developed based on our virtual
				banking APIs. I was sitting with them and provided occasional supports for configuration and coding their
				services.
			</p>

			<h4 id="hackathon-north">Hackathon - Hack The North - Working in Pivotal (Acquired by VMWare) Toronto office</h4>
			<p>
				There is a biggest hackathon event in Canada called <em>Hack The North</em>. My team was registered to host the
				same virtual online banking platform, and this is more professional environment so we decided to hire software
				consulting company called Pivotal to help us polish our front-end look and feel. The Pivotal accommodated us to
				work from their office, and I really enjoyed working there. On the day of the hackathon event, there are many
				other hosts appeared with their booths; Google and RBC are just a few of them. We actually surpassed the other
				bank competitor by the number of attendees' hackathon applications built on our platform. There was actually one
				accident happened on the hackathon competition day. There was a small JavaScript code bug on the front-end
				application and the virtual banking transaction data are misdisplayed. I quickly fixed the bug, tested on the
				staging environment, and asked my supervisor if I can deploy the fix. My supervisor was a little reluctant to do
				so because the production is already up and run, and many users are actively making access to it. I confirmed
				with my supervisor that we can easily and quickly roll back the change if anything goes wrong. Then, we deployed
				the fix to the production...It's all fixed right away!
			</p>

			<h4 id="hackathon-eleven">Hackathon - Eleven</h4>
			<p>
				There was another hackathon event as well, and it was <a
					href="https://www.hackworks.com/en/elevatehackathon">the Elevate Hackathon hosted at MARS by TD</a>, an
				innovation centre to host startups or spin-offs from major internet service companies like Facebook and AirBnB
				who has been developing innovative services.
			</p>

			<h4 id="google-canada">Google Canada - Waterloo office</h4>
			<p>
				At the end of October 2019, I went to see my mentor who used to be my direct supervisor at Research In Motion
				(RIM), which is BlackBerry now. He moved to Google after his tenure at BlackBerry, and he has been working there
				until now. One day, he messaged me through LinkedIn if I am interested to visit Google Waterloo office. It has
				been 10 years to see him, and we talked our past projects at RIM and our coworkers. Most coworkers moved to GAFA
				or simply Silicon Valley. It was a refreshing time to remember what I worked with him.
			</p>

			<h4 id="juniors">TD Associates - Juniors</h4>
			<p>
				Three TD associates joined our team during their rotation program, which enables them to pick up four different
				teams to work in TD every six months. One lady is very social and hold a strong leadership skill, one gentleman
				is very strong in coding, and the last lady was on the focus of UI/UX design. They were all doing well, and they
				eventually joined another reputable companies.
			</p>

			<h4 id="vim">Vim Toronto meetup</h4>
			<p>
				One of the TD associates who used to work for the Ryerson DMZ, and she helped me to host a technology learning
				meetup. The meetup is about learning vim, one of the software development tools based on the command line and
				well know for a not easy to learn thing.
			</p>

			<h2 id="third">Third Year</h2>
			<h4 id="work-environment-change">Work environment change</h4>
			<p>
				The third-year was a special year because of a series of work environment changes. At first the virtual online
				banking platform team was back from Pivotal office. Second, all juniors in the team left TD by their will.
				Third, my supervisor who hired me left TD. Then, my team was merged into another team. I outlined the team
				activities for the next supervisor, and I worked to support the relationships between the new supervisor and my
				team. During the period of these changes, I kept receiving the API architecture consulting works more
				and more, and I started becoming a trusted subject matter expert for many TD solutions architects. Though these
				changes were stressful, I was able to spend more time on API architecture consulting works, one of
				which is API client on-boarding for internal and external system integration with enterprise APIs.
			</p>

			<h4 id="api-client-onboarding">API Client Onboarding</h4>
			<p>
				The API client onboarding is a series of processes to enable an internal or external client software to access
				to a server which hosts an enterprise financial system resources through the API which acts as an interface
				between two systems for their integration. The criticalness of the integration exists at authentication and
				authorization between the API clients and servers. Any enterprise system do not want to accept unauthorized
				access by unauthenticated users. To avoid that, most companies have defined security frameworks. I was
				particulary responsible for the OAuth2.0 grant types selections.

			<h5 id="hybrid">Hybrid Architecture of internal and external(third-party/vendor/SaaS) microservices - API Client
				Onboarding</h5>
			<p>
				One solution architecture is presented. The front-end UI/UX is identical, but the back-end is composed by the
				mixtrue of internal enterprise middleware by enterprise APIs and vendor SaaS APIs.
			</p>
			</p>

			<h4 id="api-architecture-pattern">API Architecture Pattern</h4>
			<p>
				In parallel to my regular consulting work, I developed a new enterprise API architecture pattern called the
				Adapter API pattern which is an API server implementation pattern for point to point data mapping integration
				between two systems when they use different communication protocol for each other. One good example is a
				conversion between SOAP XML payload and RESTful JSON payload. One system only uses SOAP XML format to transfer
				data, and the other system only expects RESTful HTTPS JSON format as an input. The Adapter API server will be an
				agent between them to enable their communications. The difficult part of this API architecture pattern is the
				fact that there are many different types of existing systems who are already connected each other without
				implementing the Adapter API pattern. The time and cost is an issue, and once this API architecture pattern is
				enforced, then many existing solution designs need to be updated. This is overwelmed. The Adapter API pattern
				needs a strategy on how to update the existing systems with the Adapter API pattern.
			</p>

			<h4 id="architecture-review-board">Architecture Review Board</h4>
			<p>
				In third year, I secured my chair in the architecture review board members for API architecture domain in the
				following line of businesses:Wealth, Insrance, Securities, and Credit Card (WISC). Compared to typical core
				banking domains like retail banking, WISC domains have more flexibilities in solutions design, and this
				flexibility made me complicated to perform architecture scoring in the architecture review board meeting. The
				WISC business requirements are moving quickly and changing dynamically by which architecture patterns sometimes
				cannot be enforced.
			</p>

			<h4 id="patent-insurance">Another patent filed for TD Insurance business solution</h4>
			<p>
				Beside my regular work, I had been working with another senior architect to design an IoT business solution. The
				other senior architect is specialized for designing big data platform, and I am for API architecture of the
				exposing parts of the big data solutions which is enabled by collecting data from smart homes equipped sensors.
				We filed this solution architecture as a patent and successfully filed to be pending for granted.
			</p>

			<h4 id="api-client-onboarding-process-improve">Process improvement for the API client onboarding</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="#api-client-onboarding">The API Client Onboarding</a> is part of the entire new enterprise API creation
				process or updating process when an API client updated in an exsiting solutions architecture. One of most
				difficult requirement is the selection of OAuth2.0 grant types to secure API access. There are not too many
				selections to pick up, and solutions architects never get into trouble by that, but instead the justification of
				the choice is very difficult. By the order of the frequency to pick up the grant type, it is usually Client
				Credentials grant type for most cases. Then, Authorization code grant type comes second. Rest of solution
				designs are mostly falling into Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) and Implicit grant types. These two
				grant types have only very limited usages, and they are not major choice. It is probably not difficult to choose
				either Client Credentials or Authorization code grant type, but the problem exists at their granular use cases.
				Authorization code grant type is the best choice because it is most secured design grant type, but there is an
				implementation cost for engineers. Client Credentials grant type is easier to implement and engineering cost is
				low, but less secured compared to the Authorization code grant type. The difference between the Authorization
				code and Client Credentials is the involvement of the end user to acknowledge the delegation of their identity
				to the requested authorization service (Ex. Identity provider (IdP) like Auth0, Okta, and PingIdentity). The end
				user is prompted to acknowledge if they agree to do so, and otherwise the authorization is voided. Client
				Credentials skips that step, and no end user interaction is required. It sounds simple if no end user
				interaction is required, but the problem is that we cannot assure that the API client is compromised since the
				credentials stays permanent. For this reason, the Authorization code grant type is recommeded. The granular use
				cases are following below as a list when Client Credentials is still the choice even though the Authorization
				code grant type is better. The granular use cases list accompany with the choice of OAuth2.0 grant types. This
				list saved so much time for solutions architects.

			<ul>
				<li>Legacy systems which cannot implement OAuth2.0 but SAML + JWT</li>
				<li>End User + Client App + Client Credentials</li>
				<li>Federation of the vendor user database</li>
				<li>Middleware/back-end/BFF/microservice calls the enterprise API.</li>
			</ul>

			</p>

			<h4 id="gcp-hackathon-montreal">Google Cloud Hackathon at Montreal in 2019</h4>
			<p>
				One of my colleagues in TD who I wored together for the United Way campaign invited me to join the hackathon
				event hosted by Google in Montreal. The hackathon is about development of the solutions utilizing Google Cloud
				Platform. There are two requirements to be qualified for the competition;One is showing the target state of the
				solution architecture, and the solution must utilize the provided data sets.
			</p>

			<h4 id="gcp-next-19">Google Cloud NeXT Event in 2019</h4>
			<p>
				There is an annual event hosted by Google Cloud team as NeXT'19 for the year in San Francisco, and one of my
				colleagues invited me to the event. It was running one week long, and we stayed one of my friends house in
				Campbell, California.
			</p>
			<h5 id="visit-apple-campus">Visit Apple Campus in Cupertino, California</h5>
			<p>
				During my staying at Campbell, my frind who let myself and my colleague stay at his house took me to his
				workplace, one of Apple campus and their headquarter at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino.
			</p>

			<h4 id="inforce">AWS Re:Inforce in 2019</h4>
			<p>
				AWS launched a new cloud computing conference to focus on its security technologies as the re:Inforce event in
				2019. The first one was held at Boston, MA, and I went to there by myself with the purchase of over $1,000 CDN
				expensive ticket, flight ticket, and AirBnB booking as well. There were dozens of live sessions, and I
				deliberately choose API platform and its authentication and authorization technologies to see the next trends of
				API platform security. It was an inagural event from AWS, and I expected many buzz words and non-technical
				people gathering for recruiting engineers, but surprisingly the event was full of skilled engineers and I
				learned a lot there.
			</p>

			<h4 id="pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic started</h4>
			<p>
				Around November in 2019, there were news reporting the pandemic of the COVID-19 on TV, and it was a beginning of
				the whole global pandemic. I didn't realize how hard and serious the pandemic is until the first lockdown of the
				entire province of my residence.
			</p>

			<h2 id="fourth">Fourth Year</h2>
			<p>
				I entered my fourth year in 2020, and by the time I gained much experience by reviewing and helping hundreds of
				solution architectures through architecture review board meetings and ad-hoc API architecture consulting works.
				I sometimes redesigned the solution architectures to help the solutions architects to let them know how their
				solutions can comply to the enterprise architecture standards.
			</p>

			<h5 id="cloud-native">Cloud Native Enterprise API Architecture</h5>
			<p>
				One of the major enterprise API architecture work is to develop and enhance the enterprise API frameworks in
				multiple domains. A most basic enterprise API framework has general requirements to be secured by OAuth2 and
				being enabled to be observable by enterprise logging tools and emitting metrics as streaming data. Since the
				enterprise is getting adjusted to cloud native environment, the enterprise API framework is also required to
				equip cloud native features. One of the features is to embed the Web API SDKs from the major cloud platform.
				By embedding the cloud SDK/Web API library into the API framework, the framework can delegate some of its basic
				functionalities to the cloud service providers. There is a risk to be dependent on the cloud service
				provider/software as a service (SaaS) solutions. To mitigate the risk, the mutually agreed service level
				agreement (SLA) is required before their integration. In general, the SLA is calculated by multiplication of the
				series of the enterprise services integrated together as an SLA guaranteed service.
			<figure class="plain">
				<code class="go">

			<h5 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h5>
			<p>
				After an early few months had passed in 2020, and the COVID-19 issues getting global and worse with multiple
				nation-wide lockdown orders from Canadian government.

				I have to start something new which add a value to TD. The value will be an
				asset in TD, and it will grow their businesses. I created a list below for the value-added activities.

				Review the current TD API program to update with the latest technologies and new roadmaps.
				Refine architectural questions to interview solution designers for API client onboarding for their system
				integration projects and the architectural questions should reduce the amount of communication and backup more
				time for Enterprise Architects to focus on new architecture development.

				Develop a cloud native API architecture for existing enterprise API frameworks to utilize major public cloud
				SDK and the public cloud SDK should replace the current API framework lock-in features with public cloud
				services this will minimize the maintenance labour and cost for the API framework. The API framework developers
				can spend more time for designing new API framework features. Develop a patentable API architecture for home
				insurance domain
				Obtain Azure Cloud Architect certificate

			<p>
				Once the headquarter office decided to put all employees work from home except the essential service domains
				like customer services for branch and retail banking.
			</p>

			<h5 id="family-emergency">Family emergency</h5>
			<p>
				During the period of the work-from-home style enforced, I had a family emergency which really disrupted my
				business continuity.
			</p>

			<h5 id="reorganization">Reorganization</h5>
			<p>
				Executives told us that they will keep the existing employees job security during 2020, but they will not for
				2021. There were multiple rounds of layoffs from all over the line of businesses in the beginning of 2021. We
				also got new chief architect for the enterprise architecture, and the lady was trying to lay down some new
				foundations of architectural standards.
			</p>

			<h5 id="burn-layoff">Burnt out...and layoff</h5>
			<p>
				The working from home was exciting at first few months until the school is shutdown and my kids started staying
				at home all the time with online learning via computers. Please imagine that five-year-old girl watching the
				computer screen all day long for learning something from the virtual teachers...It might work for some parts,
				but I honestly don't agree this remote learning environment. This is because kids learning through their five
				senses from all their body parts:Listening live voices, reading paper books with their hands, write down
				something they want to express in white papers, and speak someone in front of their faces. Taking care of
				kids and family while working on the computers at home is quite difficult. There are some people saying living
				and working from home alone is also not easy, but for sure having a whole family at home is more tough. Dogs and
				cats also need some cares, but kids as human beings are privileged to get more cares, and they can demand as
				they want. It was just so much hard for me to continue working as I used to be under such a pressure to hold my
				job. It eventually came to my turn to be laid off from the work, and some other teammates as well. What I found
				was that my other teammates were the same family structure as I have. All of us have kids at home.

			<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
			<p>
				This is a short history of my last four years at TD. It is very personal and maybe not relevant to general
				readers, but I hope my experiences and some technical aspects regarding software architect career can help
				you decide to go this path. If so, we will cross in the road in the near future.
			</p>

			<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
			<p>
				I have some plans to continue to brush up my skill set, and I am looking for next opportunity to utilize them.
				The followings are some of them.

				<li>API Framework</li>
